# Reddact Game

4x Universe Domination Game. Live version can be found at http://reddactgame.com


(note: I Appologize for the sparseness in this readme. I've never written one and am working off a template at 6am. Coffee ran out an hour ago)

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
php
Apache Server system
Mysql
```

## Setup ##
Extract all files into your directory.
Upload the database to your server -- this file is located in ./setup under the name database_dump.sql

## Known Issues
* **"Connection Reset"** -- Fairly certain this is an issue on my web hosting server
* **"Empty Encounters"** -- Every so often, a beacon/encounter will show up and be completely empty. This is a known bug and being worked on
* **"Upgrades Not Upgrading"** -- this is an issue in certain browsers (Chrome, IE) that crops its head up every now and then. It may be related to the connection issue
* **"Hell Issues"** -- Users can become stuck in "hell" for longer periods of time than need be. This should be worked out in the next update.
* ** The Forum images are all broken. This is an easy fix but very low priority. 

## Future Features

* **Economy** A functional Economy, with 'stock markets' and other such features. Probably long off at this point
* **Better Battles** Random Encounters, possibly an FTL style battle system.
* **Better 'beacons'** Rehaul of the current beacon system, as well as more beacons.
